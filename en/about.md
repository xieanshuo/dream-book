## Biography
**Anshuo Xie**, also known as Master Xie, was born on May 18, 1974, in Lanzhou, the capital city of Gansu province in the northwest of China. He started his spiritual journey to pursue the truth when he was 19.

Eager to be fully aware of the Truth, he went into western and eastern religions in the past decades and dabbled widelyâ€“in Buddhism, Taoism, Yoga, Christianity, Vedanta philosophy, western spirituality, ancient civilization and Mysticism. By investigating the core ideas of all those schools carefully, he was finally convinced that the teachings of Buddha is the most ultimate and complete and can lead to final libration. 

Thenceforth he put all his heart into Buddhism and practiced dedicatedly, and got well-versed in both Exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism.

At the age of 38, in his deep silent meditation, Master Xie gradually awakened to the original nature of sentient beings. Afterwards, he continually realized the self-nature for what it really is and wisdom of original nature. And then he got aware that affliction and Bodhi are non-dual in essence; that all dharmas are void in self-nature; that reincarnation and nirvana are non-dual in essence; and that unperturbed liberation is in birth and death. Master Xie has realized the self-nature through true practice and revivified the ultimate meaning of the Great Vehicle teachings thought by Sakyamuni in simple words and vivid parables.
